# Photosharing app
Originally this was an idea to share photos with friends through an invite only website with various roles for sharing (presenter, editor, etc). 
We ended up just screen sharing over google meet. But it was fun to code for a little while. 

## Install Dependencies
Build a virtual environment and activate it
> `python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/photoshare && . ~/.virtualenvs/photoshare/bin/activate`

Update pip if you aren't on latest
> `pip install --upgrade pip` 

Install the dependencies
> `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, the application can be run as a module from the command line with
> `python3 -m app`
